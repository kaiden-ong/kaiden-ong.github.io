                                    <p>Applying my learning outside of class has always been a passion of mine. When it comes to coding, I love to make things that are useful and practical in my life. During this past summer of 2023, I have worked on multiple projects that I'm excited to complete and use. First are my two discord bots, one is the classic ToDo List & Pomodoro Study Bot and the other is a Leetcode Bot to help motivate me to stay on top of my coding practice. Additionally, this website was started in the beginning of September 2023, and has taken about a month to complete. It has taught me a lot about the process of completing a project and the struggles that come with it as well.</p>

                                    <p>Within the last year, I've started listening to podcasts and keeping up with the tech industry as a whole. My two favorites at the moment are 1) Darknet Diaries & 2) The Changelog. I started listening to the Darknet Diary while taking my cybersecurity class during spring '23 after my professor recommended it. My favorite episode so far has been Lotería, where Jack Rhysider, the host, talks about how a drug cartel was able to steal millions of dollars from the Puerto Rican government. The changelog has also piqued my interest recently as they often discuss new and cutting edge technologies in the software development sphere.</p>

                                    <p>As the world has transitioned more and more towards short-form media, I've found that reading books has really helped me to improve focus and learn about the world around me. Recently, my favorite genres have been historical fiction and biographies. While seemingly just a kid's graphic novel, <u>When Stars Are Scattered</u> by Omar Mohamed and Victoria Jameison has been one of my favorite reads in the past few months. My favorite line in that book goes something like this: It's not about what life hands you, but it's about what you do with what life hands you. I love this because it's something that my father preached when I was young and something that really holds true to me.</p>

                                    <p>I've come to learn that teaching and learning go hand in hand. Teaching is a skill to be mastered and it truly is the best way to reinforce knowledge. However, along the way, I've learned something completely new through the interations with those I've tutored. For the past two years, I've been tutoring math at the Renton Technical College and it's been an eye opening opportunity, listening to the story of students from all walks of life including immigrants, single parents, and everything in between. I've come to realize that I can only truly understand the world and the people in it, when I step out of my comfort zone and look beyond my own perspective.</p>
